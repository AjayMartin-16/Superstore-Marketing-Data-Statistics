# README: Supermarket Statistics Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing supermarket sales data using applied statistical techniques. The goal is to derive key insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance using various statistical measures and visualization techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset contains transaction-level data for a supermarket, including details such as product categories, sales revenue, discounts, customer demographics, and purchase timestamps.

## Key Analyses Performed

### 1. Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Handled missing values and duplicate records.
- Standardized column names and formatted timestamps.
- Created new derived variables for enhanced analysis.

### 2. Descriptive Statistics
- Summary statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation) for key numerical columns.
- Frequency distribution of product categories and customer demographics.
- Sales distribution by time of day, day of the week, and month.

### 3. Inferential Statistics
- Hypothesis testing to evaluate significant differences in sales across different product categories.
- Correlation analysis to identify relationships between discounts and sales volume.
- Regression modeling to predict future sales trends based on historical data.

### 4. Data Visualization
- Bar charts for sales distribution across different product categories.
- Line graphs to analyze sales trends over time.
- Heatmaps to visualize customer purchase patterns.
- Pie charts for customer segmentation analysis.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python (Jupyter Notebook / Colab)**: Data processing and statistical computations.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **SciPy & Statsmodels**: Hypothesis testing and statistical modeling.

## How to Use the Notebook
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
2. Ensure all required libraries are installed (use `pip install -r requirements.txt` if needed).
3. Run each cell sequentially to load the dataset, clean data, perform analysis, and generate visualizations.

## Insights & Findings
- The highest sales revenue comes from the **[most popular product category]**.
- Discounted items show **[positive/negative]** correlation with overall sales volume.
- Peak sales occur during **[specific time periods]**, indicating optimal business hours.
- Customer segmentation analysis reveals **[key demographic trends]**.

## Future Scope
- Implement advanced machine learning models for predictive sales analysis.
- Conduct time-series forecasting to better understand seasonal sales trends.
- Expand the dataset by integrating external data sources for deeper insights.


## Conclusion
This supermarket statistics analysis provides valuable insights into sales performance, customer preferences, and business trends. The findings can help supermarkets optimize inventory, pricing strategies, and marketing efforts to maximize profitability.
